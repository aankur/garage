The design section helps you to see Garage from a "big picture"
perspective.  It will allow you to understand if Garage is a good fit for
you, how to better use it, how to contribute to it, what can Garage could
and could not do, etc.

- **[Goals and use cases](@/documentation/design/goals.md):** This page explains why Garage was concieved and what practical use cases it targets.

- **[Related work](@/documentation/design/related-work.md):** This pages presents the theoretical background on which Garage is built, and describes other software storage solutions and why they didn't work for us.

- **[Internals](@/documentation/design/internals.md):** This page enters into more details on how Garage manages data internally.
